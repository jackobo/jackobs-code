1.	Mockups screen – replace the bottom dynamic layouts part with a dropdown, to choose from default, layout 1, layout 2.
	#2.	Allow duplicating content to a new dynamic layout, so you don’t have to start from scratch (as discussed – from scratch, from default, from another layout)
3.	Replace between lobby arena and games arena on the left bar – PLEASE IGNORE this one. I will talk to Or and Ofir first
	#4.	Add search bar to the games list on the right bar, and the games list in the center
5.	Double click on error would take to the relevant screen
	#6.	Allow adding multiple items at once (e.g. adding multiple games to an arena)
7.	Add the option to export the data to an XL file
8.	Add a warning message when the user tries to close the app without saving (see the end of the BRD for text)
9.	Make the filters work (clicking on it will filter the list of games accordingly)
10.	Filters list on the right will change according to the arena currently being edited.

I’ll check with Ofir & Or:
1.	Dynamic layouts condition no. of rounds works by game type - I’ll verify with Ofir that it’s OK
2.	I’ll check if we can allow more than 2 dynamic layouts as requested by or
3.	I’ll consult the order of the items in the list on the left
